# Pi-Finding-Algorithms

This repository includes my take on creating pi finding algorithms 
most of the animations will be made using manim so if you want you 
can install it here: https://github.com/3b1b/manim

Algorithms are already there on the internet I'm just testing my skills 
to animate them.

If possible in future, I may find my own algorithm to do this,
till then (fingers crossed) enjoy those that I've already uploaded 
through animations.
